// TODO
// CIRCUIT/CONTENT BUGS
* burnt battery bug: when a burnt battery is in series with a working battery, the bulb lights up, which shouldn't

* URGENT: issue with parallel circuit with battery v=4 and 3 resistors r=1 --> battery burns!

* burnt battery: disable the slider

* fix the light bulb shade

* add light rays to the bulbs!

* add "resistor" to the resistor

* bug: when creating a new component, sometimes it creates 2!

* add units for V, I, and R


// CSS BUGS
* [WIP] fix the style of the model frame and probe

* [WIP] fix position of elements for different screens


// INTERACTION/REPRESENTATION BUGS
* [DONE] merge the two conditions into one code

* drag components from the toolbar in order to create a new one, instead of tapping on it

* sliders bug: mouse interaction doesn't work. 

* make the information button more visible

* fix the content of help texts for control condition (it is 3 texts but should be 4)

* highlight the magnifying glass

* the trash has no sound!

* improve the interaction with the sliders, it is not smooth enough 	

* when reset --> the sliders need to be reset to 1

* change the appearance of resistors for different resistances

* check why the info button disappears some times!

* enable switching between touch and mouse interactions 

* don't let the components to get out of the box when the controlpoints are dragged. I added a conditional to 
	touchDrag function of controlpoints, but did not work
