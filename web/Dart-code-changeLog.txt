THINGS TO FIX LATER:
1. FIX THE PROBLEM WITH PUB SERVE
2. FIX THE PROBLEM WITH SINGLEWHERE ERROR FOR GETTING AN EDGE
3. FIX THE CODE FOR RESIGING THE WINDOW
4. MAKE THE SLIDERS WORK BETTER; MAKE SURE THEY WORK CORRECTLY WITH MOUSE EVENTS
6. FIX THE DELETE CODE: DELETE THE CONNECTED COMPONENTS WHEN THE DRAGGED COMPONENT IS NOT ON THE DELETEBOX, BUT THE CONNECTED CIRCUIT IS 

*** notes on 02/19/2015
1. merging the two conditions into one code
	main.dart: added a condition switch
	copied probe.html, probe.dart, and css/probeToolbar.css
	copied a 2nd version of dart/model.dart --> now they are two files: agentModel.dart & lumpModel.dart
	track where the model is called:
	--> main.dart: if condition --> model
	--> help.dart
	style issues: fixed default.css --> #model1

1.Changing the brightness of light bulb
	I changed the bulb-on and bulb-off colors
	A drop shadow is added (it first draws bulb-off, then the shadow (with radius proportional with current)
	and then bulb-on image.
2. Adding a battery info page for condition = 0

1. DART OLD ISSUE: fix the issue with mixing the touch event and mouse event.
   For example, creating two components. (Update: Mike: this is windows 8 issue, cannot get fixed, just switch between the modes)
2. DART OLD ISSUE: fix the issue with changing the circuit configuration 
	when clicking/holding the click on a component or a control point!!
	SOLVED(?): I don't know why but it seems that running pub serve interferes with running the code.
	I unchecked the pub serve in manage launches and the weird things are all gone!!
3. DART OLD ISSUE: slider change not updating the value
	UPDATE: it workes with touch events, but I should later test it with the mouse events

1. cleaned up the code, created an app.dart file and moved the App class from main.dart
2. organized the settings for conditions
3. working on the css styles

*** notes on 6/27/2016
1. setting the screen with CANVAS_RATIO and HELP_RATIO
2. I don't remember what those were for: probe.html, probe.dart, and probeToolbar.css
	investigation: they are for condition 1 and battery for condition 2 which show the V, I, R values
3. I first set the canvas to be the same size as the workspace, but then realized that I can draw the help text
	so I changed the canvas size to be the whole screen.
	Now I have issues with drawing control points outside of the workingbox

*** notes on 7/1/2016
1. remove sliders in the toolbar (just leaving the generic slider)
