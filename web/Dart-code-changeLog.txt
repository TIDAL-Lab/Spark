THINGS TO FIX LATER:
1. FIX THE PROBLEM WITH PUB SERVE
2. FIX THE PROBLEM WITH SINGLEWHERE ERROR FOR GETTING AN EDGE
3. FIX THE CODE FOR RESIGING THE WINDOW
4. MAKE THE SLIDERS WORK BETTER; MAKE SURE THEY WORK CORRECTLY WITH MOUSE EVENTS
6. FIX THE DELETE CODE: DELETE THE CONNECTED COMPONENTS WHEN THE DRAGGED COMPONENT IS NOT ON THE DELETEBOX, BUT THE CONNECTED CIRCUIT IS 

*** notes on 02/19/2015
1. merging the two conditions into one code
	main.dart: added a condition switch
	copied probe.html, probe.dart, and css/probeToolbar.css
	copied a 2nd version of dart/model.dart --> now they are two files: agentModel.dart & lumpModel.dart
	track where the model is called:
	--> main.dart: if condition --> model
	--> help.dart
	style issues: fixed default.css --> #model1

1.Changing the brightness of light bulb
	I changed the bulb-on and bulb-off colors
	A drop shadow is added (it first draws bulb-off, then the shadow (with radius proportional with current)
	and then bulb-on image.
2. Adding a battery info page for condition = 0

1. DART OLD ISSUE: fix the issue with mixing the touch event and mouse event.
   For example, creating two components. (Update: Mike: this is windows 8 issue, cannot get fixed, just switch between the modes)
2. DART OLD ISSUE: fix the issue with changing the circuit configuration 
	when clicking/holding the click on a component or a control point!!
	SOLVED(?): I don't know why but it seems that running pub serve interferes with running the code.
	I unchecked the pub serve in manage launches and the weird things are all gone!!
3. DART OLD ISSUE: slider change not updating the value
	UPDATE: it workes with touch events, but I should later test it with the mouse events

*** notes on 6/25/2016
1. cleaned up the code, created an app.dart file and moved the App class from main.dart
2. organized the settings for conditions
3. working on the css styles

*** notes on 6/27/2016
1. setting the screen with CANVAS_RATIO and HELP_RATIO
2. I don't remember what those were for: probe.html, probe.dart, and probeToolbar.css
	investigation: they are for condition 1 and battery for condition 2 which show the V, I, R values
3. I first set the canvas to be the same size as the workspace, but then realized that I can draw the help text
	so I changed the canvas size to be the whole screen.
	Now I have issues with drawing control points outside of the workingbox

*** notes on 7/1/2016
1. remove sliders in the toolbar (just leaving the generic slider)	

*** notes on 7/18/2016
1. modifying the way that the circuit is connected to different models for different conditions	
	it is currently a big mess
	
*** notes on 7/31/2016
1. before the working box was a rectangle object, which made updating the width and height of it difficult and messy
	now I changed it, there is no object anymore, and just drawing a rectangle in the draw() function based on
	updated width and height after reseting or resizing the window (similar to the frame rectangle)
2. I now use the USE_SERVER flag inside the sendData() function (inside circuit object) 
	if it is condition 3 (non-AR) it does not send data to server, but using pubnub it sends it directly to the iframe
	but if it is condition 4 (AR) it sends data to server
	both functions for sending data (both conditions 3 & 4) are written in sendData.js file.

1. trying to fix the issue with initiating the electron model when the app starts
	(right now, it does not show the battery on the electron model before the first interaction)
	ok, I sort of fixed some of the issues, but still the pubnub publish/subscribe works strangely
2. working on condition 4, trying to make the AR working.

*** notes on 8/14/2016
1. working on the parseDelete function and the issue with not correctly updating objects on parseDelete
