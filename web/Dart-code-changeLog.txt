2. FIX THE PROBLEM WITH SINGLEWHERE ERROR FOR GETTING AN EDGE
3. FIX THE CODE FOR RESIGING THE WINDOW
4. MAKE THE SLIDERS WORK BETTER; MAKE SURE THEY WORK CORRECTLY WITH MOUSE EVENTS

1. merging the two conditions into one code
	main.dart: added a condition switch
	copied probe.html, probe.dart, and css/probeToolbar.css
	copied a 2nd version of dart/model.dart --> now they are two files: agentModel.dart & lumpModel.dart
	track where the model is called:
	--> main.dart: if condition --> model
	--> help.dart
	style issues: fixed default.css --> #model1

1. DART OLD ISSUE: fix the issue with mixing the touch event and mouse event.
   For example, creating two components. (Update: Mike: this is windows 8 issue, cannot get fixed, just switch between the modes)
2. DART OLD ISSUE: fix the issue with changing the circuit configuration 
	when clicking/holding the click on a component or a control point!!
	SOLVED(?): I don't know why but it seems that running pub serve interferes with running the code.
	I unchecked the pub serve in manage launches and the weird things are all gone!!
3. DART OLD ISSUE: slider change not updating the value
	UPDATE: it workes with touch events, but I should later test it with the mouse events
